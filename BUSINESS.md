## 👤 Founder: Tommy Alchemy (Thomas Nichols)

### The Origin Story

**New York City (2013-2020):**
- Moved away from home at 18, started bartending illegally in NYC
- Terrible student, no degree — bartending was the craft he could excel at
- By 22-23: head bartender, top-tier craft cocktail skills
- Late NYC days: Got permission to film cocktail videos in a Harlem bar
- Goal: Build a YouTube channel (never gained much traction — 6k followers to this day)

**COVID Era (2020-2021):**
- COVID decimated hospitality industry
- Moved back to Colorado, took handyman/contractor jobs and DoorDash to get by
- Built a basement bar at home to film YouTube videos (still doing it wrong, but learning)
- Listened to random podcast about Airbnb Experiences
- Put up a cocktail class on Airbnb in Erie, Colorado (small town between Boulder/Denver)
- **Key insight:** Shocked by how many bookings came in for a basement class in a rental house
- Had the full cocktail setup from YouTube production — perfect for classes

**Philly Consulting & Moving South (2021-2022):**
- Did consulting job in Philly, met a girl, got distracted
- Landlord gave two-week notice (had built out his basement, never benefited)
- Two weeks at parents' house
- Decision: Move South to start events company
- COVID restrictions still too strict in Colorado
- Researched Nashville, Charlotte, Charleston
- **Charleston won:** Private events with alcohol = no regulation (as long as private, not cash bar)
  - Nashville: Required physical location that served food (weird law)
  - Charlotte: Required two separate entities for alcohol pickup/service, month-long temp licenses

**Charleston Launch (May 2022):**
- Moved to Charleston, rented a bedroom
- Got hired immediately at Little Palm (Death & Co. consulting group was opening it)
- Worked with Death & Co. team (Gin & Luck consulting)
- Day shifts Monday-Friday, kept taking Thumbtack leads for events on side
- Realized: events = way more work than cocktail classes
- Strategy: Google every downtown bar, find ones that don't open till 5-6 PM
- **First bar contacted = yes:** Faculty Lounge on Huge Street, Wagner Terrace neighborhood

**Going Full-Time (Oct 2022):**
- Company founded mid-2022 (roughly June/July)
- Within 5 months: Quit day job by October
- Sustained through holiday season + slow Jan/Feb months as solo founder
- February 2023: Finally put on Viator (should have done this sooner)
- **Viator = explosion moment**

## 📈 Business Overview

### Sip History - Interactive Cocktail Classes

**Concept:**
- 2-hour interactive cocktail classes in off-hours bars
- 20-25% structured, 80% improvised
- Mix of history, technique, hands-on, jokes, drinking
- Three cocktails included (chronological history: daiquiri → old-fashioned → bee's knees)
- Host to guest ratio: 1:20 (sometimes 2:40 on busy nights)

**Business Model (Win-Win-Win-Win):**
1. **Guests win:** Unique experience, fun, educational, 5000+ 5-star reviews
2. **Bars win:** Brings people during dead hours, 10% of ticket sales for doing nothing
3. **Hosts win:** Pre-shifted, put on a show, great tips, same money as 6-8 hour shift in 3-4 hours
4. **Owners win:** Insanely high profit margin (~60% even after paying hosts)

**Key Methodology: "Zoom In and Zoom Out"**

Two meanings:
1. **Read the room:** Handle mixed groups (bachelorette parties + serious cocktail nerds)
   - Example: 18 seats bachelorette, 2 seats couple — blast with the party, nerd out with the couple
   - Make it fun for everyone no matter who shows up
   
2. **Ebb and flow:** Balance history, technique, drinking, fun, jokes
   - Know when to interrupt flow for history (short, snappy, concise)
   - Script evolved over time (now pretty much perfect)
   - Stagger attention, keep it dynamic

### Alchemix - Retail Products

**Product Line:**
- 8 non-alcoholic cocktail syrups
- 3 non-alcoholic mixers
- 4 alcoholic bitters
- 1 salt rim blend
- 1 sugar rim blend
- 8-piece cocktail kit with bar tools

**History:**
- Started ~1.5 years into cocktail classes (late 2023)
- Bootstrapped out of Tommy's apartment (insane)
- Easy upsell for class patrons
- All mixers used in Sip History classes are Alchemix products

**Bar Kit Journey:**
- Working on it since COVID
- First sample orders from China arrived in NYC apartment pre-COVID
- 2024: Indian friend connected Tommy with manufacturer in Delhi, India
- 6-month development process
- $40-80k investment over time
- Now: Warehouse full of bar kits

**Current State:**
- 2024: ~$120k in retail sales
- 95% from cocktail class patrons (in-person upsell)
- Use Shopify POS, collect sales in-person, ship to tourists
- **Future:** Needs to become standalone business with D2C marketing funnels, Amazon, wholesale

  - Wed-Sun: 1 class/day (1-3 PM or 5-7 PM)
- Status: Not busy enough yet, host not working out (sales issue)
- Challenge: Need new host ASAP (Tommy leaving for Charleston end of Feb, Santa Barbara March 1)

**Coming Soon:**

### Platform Strategy

**Distribution:**

## 🎯 Key Business Concepts

### Location Escape Velocity

**Definition:** The ability to launch a new location, get it busy enough to support a host full or part-time, and then leave to scale the next location.

**Critical bottleneck:** As bootstrapped startup, Tommy has to:
1. Go to new location
2. Host classes himself initially (business sustains him)
3. Find the right person
4. Get location busy enough for host to make good living
5. Hand off fully and move to next location

**Challenges:**
- Hosts need to be on-call as location gets busy
- Hosts need other job to sustain themselves initially
- Delicate balance: host needs enough classes to go full/part-time before Tommy can leave
- If host quits when location is busy = Tommy has to fly in immediately (doesn't scale)

**Solution in progress:**
- Finding hosts faster
- Getting locations busy faster (ads, marketing, review strategy)
- Professional training program (feeder system for talent)

### Getting a New Location Busy Fast

**Current problem:** Bookings always start slow.

**Why slow:**
- Need reviews across all platforms (Viator, GetYourGuide, Airbnb, Google)
- OTAs don't promote you until you have reviews
- Takes months to build up

**Solution strategy:**
1. Run Facebook + Google ads to collect direct bookings (needs refinement)
2. Plug-and-play launch process
3. Rapid review generation
4. Get to 50-100 reviews per platform ASAP

**Goal:** Launch location → busy in weeks, not months → hire host → move on.

## 💼 Strategic Partnerships

### Sushi Bar Group (Major Opportunity)

**Background:**
- Feb 2025: Tommy + Elise went to Miami for boat show (Polaris-sponsored)
- Tried Sushi Bar (2-hour omakase experience)
- Elise emailed founder as thank-you
- Founder started similar way during COVID (using dead restaurant space)
- Clicked over business model discussion

**Current locations:**
- Nashville (Golden Sound)
- Giletto Beach (Santa Barbara) — launching Sip History March 2026
- Charleston (just opened, got Alchemix as wholesale)
- Austin, Dallas, Chicago, Miami, New York (hotel opening)
- Other California locations

**Why this matters:**
- If it goes well with this group = potential to scale to 10+ locations
- Well-funded group, expansion-minded
- Proven concept alignment (off-hours space utilization)

---

## 🚧 Current Challenges & Priorities

### Immediate (Feb-March 2026)

1. **Nashville host situation:** Find new host in 1 week or pivot current host to management
2. **Santa Barbara launch:** March 1 deadline, new market, need to get busy fast
3. **Charleston trip:** Last week of Feb, content creation with Jack

### Short-Term (Q1-Q2 2026)

1. **Organizational systems:** Back-end chaos from 3 years of operator mode
   - Accounting (minimal so far)
   - Marketing (mostly organic growth, need structured approach)
   - Operations documentation
   - Training protocols
   
2. **Marketing systems:**
   - Facebook/Google ads for direct bookings (need refinement)
   - SEO/GEO optimization
   - Organic posting strategy
   - Video content pipeline
   
3. **Location escape velocity playbook:**
   - Standardized launch process
   - Host finding/training protocol
   - Rapid review generation
   - Handoff checklist

4. **Retail independence:**
   - D2C marketing funnels
   - Amazon launch
   - Wholesale strategy (bars, shops)

### Medium-Term (2026)

1. **Agent team build-out:**
   - Azoth (developer agent) — landing pages, eventually internal software
   - Accounting agent (ASAP priority)
   - Marketing agents (SEO/GEO, paid ads, organic posting, video editor)
   
2. **Reservation software:**
   - Current: Boken (best so far, still shitty)
   - Previous disasters: Shopify, Fair Harbor, Peak Pro, ResD, Xola
   - Pain points: Syncing issues, overbooking, underbooking, cancellations, OTA integrations
   - **Opportunity:** Build competitor internally
     - Start with Nashville only
     - Sync all bookings via webhooks
     - Google Calendar integration
     - Multi-platform capacity management
     - Custom payment portal
     - Waivers integration
   - Competitors are so bad there's a huge market opportunity
   - Tourism industry = non-technical founders, old-timers, ghost tours/pub crawls
   - Most don't even know this type of software exists
   
3. **Professional training program:**
   - Poach best talent for Sip History hosts
   - Borderline free classes for industry professionals
   - Feeder business (could be profitable on its own)
   - Solve host bottleneck problem
   - Target young people (not jaded old-timers)
   - Vibrant crew (appeals to bachelorette parties)

### Long-Term (Future Vision)

1. **Booze News:**
   - Daily show + newsletter
   - Alcohol industry content
   - Target: industry professionals
   - Purpose: Build reach, find talent, establish authority
   
2. **Spirits brand:**
   - Contract distill gin (or other spirits)
   - Vertical integration
   - Brand extension from Alchemix
   
3. **Scale Sip History:**
   - 20+ locations

## 📚 Lessons Learned (Hard Way)

### Hiring Mistakes

**2024 Charleston hire:**
- Hired wrong guy to run Charleston so Tommy could expand
- Trained him extensively, moved to Savannah
- Guy screwed them over (details not important)
- Lesson: Learn who to do business with

**Nashville current situation:**
- Host can't sell (critical flaw for this business)
- On-call requirement + need for other job = delicate balance
- Need better hiring process for hosts

### New Orleans Bar Disaster (April-Aug 2025)

**What happened:**
- Met at Tales of the Cocktail 2024
- Real estate agent connected them with "worst human ever"
- Management services agreement for struggling bar (Duplex)
- Owner had juice bar downstairs, bar upstairs
- Didn't find out till later: Owner owed landlord $100k
- Landlord evicted owner within 5 months
- Owner ransacked and wrecked the place
- New Orleans laws made it hard to fight
- Low capital lost (didn't invest in build-out), but lots of time lost

**Lessons:**
- Good business deal with wrong person = disaster
- Someone willing to commit crimes can fuck you over
- Vet partners thoroughly
- Don't get distracted by shiny opportunities (opening a bar)
- Cocktail class model is more scalable than bar ownership

### Platform Learning Curve

**Mistakes:**
- Waited too long to add Viator (Feb 2023, should have been earlier)
- Did a lot wrong with platforms initially
- Learned too late: need independent listing on each platform
- Hard to stand out from noise

**Lessons:**
- OTAs are critical for tourism business
- Reviews across all platforms = SEO for discovery
- Platform strategy from day 1 in new markets

### Reservation Software Hell

**Tried and hated:**
1. Shopify (sounds insane, but there was a way — never worked well)
2. Fair Harbor (hated it)
3. Peak Pro (hated it)
4. ResD (hated it briefly)
5. Xola (complete bag of fucking cocks)
6. Boken (best so far, still has tons of challenges)

**Problems:**
- OTA sync breaks constantly
- Overbooking issues
- Underbooking issues (thinks it's sold out when it's not)
- Doesn't mark cancellations properly
- Capacity management wrong
- Need to fix integrations constantly

**Why they all suck:**
- Industry serves non-technical founders
- Ghost tours, pub crawls, cooking classes
- Old-timers or people who just want to run fun experiences
- Most don't even know multi-platform sync exists
- Those who do know can't figure it out (too messy)

## 💭 Tommy's Notes

_"I was a terrible student, horrible in school. Bartending was the craft I could excel at without a degree."_

_"The business took off organically so well in Charleston — minimal accounting, minimal marketing. Now it's time to build the systems."_

_"If somebody quits when a location is busy, it pretty much fucks me. I need to go there immediately. That doesn't work long-term."_

_"With you and other agents, I want to make a team of 2 feel like a team of 30."_

_"I've tried like five or six reservation softwares and they've all literally sucked the biggest bag of dicks you could ever imagine."_
